Antiform: This one cannot be obtained by normal means.

Every time you drive into Valor, Wisdom, Limit, and Maste form you increase your antipoints counter by one.
Everytime you get the antiform you substract 4 antipoints.
Everytime you go into Final form you substract 10 antipoints.


### Probability chart

| Antipoints      | Probability |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Under 5         | 0%          |
| Between 5 and 9 | 10%         |
| Above 10        | 25%         |
The ability Light and Darkness makes it so when going into Valor, Wisdom, Limit or Master you always go into antiform.

The ability Dark Domination removes the antipoint system and instead you get Antiform as a form you can toggle at will.
