## Making a choice
One of the first things you'll want to do to get started with Kingdom Keys is to make your choice in the [[Systems/Station of Awakening\|Station of Awakening]] to do this press the Open Menu key (default is M, see [[Key Binds\|Key Binds]]).
When opening the menu before making your choice you will be prompted to go to the [[Systems/Station of Awakening\|Station of Awakening]]. You will be asked to make 2 choices by right clicking the Pedestals which will determine which of the 3 level paths (Warrior, Mystic and Guardian) as well as your starting stats. After you confirm your choices you will be returned to wherever you were previously.

Now that you've made a choice you can now open the [[Main Menu\|Main Menu]] which allows you to view your stats, equip items, equip abilities, etc.

## Your first Keyblade
One of the key features of Kingdom Keys are the [[items/Weapons/Keyblades\|Keyblades]] so you'll likely want to aim to get one first in order to get one you need the following:
1. Access to the [[Main Menu\|Main Menu]]
2. A [[items/Synthesis Recipe\|Synthesis Recipe]] and [[items/Synthesis Materials\|Synthesis Materials]]
3. A [[Moogle\|Moogle]] or [[blocks/Moogle Projector\|Moogle Projector]]
4. A [[Keychains\|Keychain]]
You should already have the first if you made your choice. This will allow you to equip the [[Keychains\|Keychain]] once you obtain it.

[[items/Synthesis Recipe\|Synthesis Recipes]] can be found in the chests inside of Moogle Houses in villages and dropped rarely from hostile mobs. The recipes will hold random recipes for Keyblades right clicking while holding them will learn the recipe.

Most [[items/Synthesis Materials\|Synthesis Materials]] can be mined from their respective ores which are found at different heights and some in certain biomes some also have Nether and End variants see the [[blocks/Ores\|Ores]] page for more info. Myhtril materials are obtained through [[Systems/Synthesis\|Synthesis]] you can also find [[Blox Clusters\|Blox Clusters]] which sometimes will contain [[blocks/Bug Blox\|Prize Blox and Rare Prize Blox]]. 

Once you have learnt a recipe you can use that recipe in the [[Systems/Synthesis\|Synthesis]] menu which is accessed by either a [[Moogle\|Moogle]] or a [[blocks/Moogle Projector\|Moogle Projector]] (the block form of a [[Moogle\|Moogle]]) you can find Moogles randomly wandering like any other peaceful mob but if you want consistent access you can use a [[blocks/Moogle Projector\|Moogle Projector]] which is obtained by killing a [[Moogle\|Moogle]] with a falling Anvil.

Any [[items/Synthesis Materials\|Synthesis Materials]] you are holding will need to be deposited by going to the Materials menu and clicking "Deposit". Then in the [[Systems/Synthesis\|Synthesis]] menu you can select the recipe you want to create and it will display which materials are needed however there is another requirement which is the tier as long as your tier is equal or is above the recipe's tier you can create the item. To increase your synthesis tier you need to gain EXP from creating items with [[Systems/Synthesis\|Synthesis]].

After you have created a [[Keychains\|Keychain]] all you need to is open the Main Menu navigate to "Items > Equipment" then click the "---" next to "Weapon" this menu will show all the Keychains you are holding, select your Keychain to equip it now you can now summon your Keyblade with the Summon Weapon key (Default G see [[Key Binds\|Key Binds]]) which will put it in the current hotbar slot, pressing it again will desummon it. Congratulations! You got your first Keyblade.
