# About Kingdom Keys

Kingdom Keys is a Minecraft mod made with Minecraft Forge for 1.20.1 and below and NeoForge for 1.21+ it aims to replicate many of the mechanics and features from the Kingdom Hearts games with a Minecraft spin. It was originally created in 2013 and has had many changes over the years and is still in active development though it has been quite slow due to our small team size and this being a side hobby project.

Some of the features include, a command menu and main menu styled after Kingdom Hearts II with a functioning Keyblade summoning system with almost every Keyblade featured in the entire Kingdom Hearts series (120+), Drive Form, Ability system, Level system, Magic, Organization XIII system with weapon summoning and Limits, Shotlocks plus more.
