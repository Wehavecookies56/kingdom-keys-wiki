The Station of Awakening is a dimension that contains a platform with three pedestals used to make your starting choices it is accessed by trying to open the [[Main Menu\|Main Menu]] once you have confirmed your choices it is inaccessible without using commands.

There are three pedestals with the Dream Sword, Dream Staff and Dream Shield these represent the Warrior, Mystic and Guardian paths respectively. You have to take one of these three first which gives you 1 extra for the stat it represents and determines your stat growth and level that certain abilities are gained. Then for the remaining two you must sacrifice one of them which will reduce one of your starting stats by 1 depending on the one you chose.

> [!example] 
> Take Dream Sword (Warrior) and Sacrifice Dream Shield (Guardian)
> At level 1 you will have: 
> * 2 strength
> * 1 magic
> * 0 defence
> 

The ability and stat gains from levels for each chosen path are data driven and have JSON files which allows for a data pack to change them however you like. For a full view of all 3 paths for stat and ability gains see [here](https://levelling.kingdomkeys.online/) this page displays the default paths but it can also read custom JSON files.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you have cheats enabled or are a server operator you can quickly skip this by using
`/kingdomkeys choice <chosen> <sacrificed>`
