The Gummi Hangar allows you to build Gummi Ships, they can be obtained by crafting as follows:

Once crafted it will look something like this (this screen is heavily work in progress)

1. Name, required to build or export into a blueprint.
2. Import a blueprint into the hangar, allows you to visualize it to help you build it.
3. Export the current designed ship into a blueprint.
4. Blueprint slot, allows for import and export buttons to work.
5. Fuel slot, once a combustible item is placed it will get converted to FE and stored in the buffer.
6. Engine power, higher the more engines you place.
7. Firepower, (currently) number of weapons found in the design.
8. Weight, each block increases weight, some like obsidian have twice the weight.
9. Armor, maximum health the ship has, based on the blocks and type of blocks (shell and dispel grant more armor).
10. Effective Speed, a formula which balances engine power and weight, basically the real max speed.
11. Mobility: rotation speed, increased by adding Gummi Aero blocks.
12. Seats, amount of people who can mount on the ship, varies with different cockpits.
13. Move ship lower
14. Move ship forward
15. Move ship higher
16. Move ship to the left
17. Move ship backwards
18. Move ship to the right
19. Build the ship (from blocks to an entity, requires a [[blocks/Gummi Core block\|Gummi Core block]] block and a cockpit to be able to sit on).
20. Edit the ship (disassemble from an entity to blocks).
21. Area indicator, cycle between off, odd and even, all it does is make the lines display in the X axis even or odd to help you build your ship.
22. Energy indicator, internal Forge Energy buffer, if another mod which adds FE is present you can refill it with it.
23. Upgrade button to increase the hangar level, allowing for bigger ships and faster energy transfering. Costs are 15000, 30000, 70000 and 130000.
