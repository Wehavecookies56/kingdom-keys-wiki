Gummi meteorites are blocks found in clusters randomly through the overworld.
Once mined they drop Gummi Fragments which then can be used to craft various Gummi Blocks.

They can also drop some Keyblade upgrade materials like Fluorite, Damascus, Adamantite and Electrum, also they are affected by Fortune.
