The Moogle Projector is a block form of the [[Moogle\|Moogle]] and can be obtained by killing a [[Moogle\|Moogle]] with a falling Anvil.

It can do the following:
* View, deposit and take materials
* Upgrade [[items/Keyblades\|Keyblades]] with the [[Keyblade Forge\|Keyblade Forge]]
* Synthesise items with [[Synthesis\|Synthesis]]
By default, unless changed in the config, it does not have access to the shop, for that you will need to find a [[Moogle\|Moogle]].
