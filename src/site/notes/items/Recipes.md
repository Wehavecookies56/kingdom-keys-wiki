>[!tip] Recipe tier
>Note: The level indicates when they can drop the recipe, the actual recipe range is random based on the level, which means a level 27 enemy has more probabilities to drop a C tier recipe than a level 16 enemy, but both are able to.

>[!tip] How to get S, SS and SSS recipes?
>For tier S, SS and SSS they can only drop naturally in the Realm of Darkness, where heartless can be level 200 based on how far away you are from the 0, 0 coordenates.
